cross-shell (0.2.1.oi1) asimov; urgency=low

  * New version.
  * Added debian/copyright.
  * Removed cross-shell.conf, unused.
  * cross-shell, slind-core, slind-control reorganization:
    - Added /etc/cross-shell/config as a part of getting rid of
      slind-core. This config file contains settings necessary for
      cross-shell functioning.
    - cross-sh split into cross-sh and cross-bs. 'pack' functionality
      moved to sc-pack-rootfs, because it is not related to cross-shell.
      - devs.tar, add-dev.sh are moved to slind-control.
    - bumped debootstrap dependency - cross-bs needs debootstrap with
      'asimov' script.
  
  * debian/rules rewritten using debhelper.
